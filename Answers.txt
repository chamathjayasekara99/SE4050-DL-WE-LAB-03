1) The input signal transition 1 to 0.5 , start from 7 to 9  and again move to 1 from 10 .After applying the filter in the result output it shows the changes in the 
input signal.Same approached used for images by computer to identify intensity changes of each pixel of an image. consider values 0 -> 12 are pixel values for image [1,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,1,1] ,and filer is [1,-1] where filter will be applied across  left to right of image pixel vector.Computer does calculations as below.

(1*1)+(1*(-1)) = 0
-
-
-
6th position
(1*1)+(1*(0.5)) = 0.5
-
-
-
9th position
(0.5*1)+(1*(-1)) =-0.5

Here in 5th to 6th position there is a presence of an edge or transition from darker to lighter pixels , in the other hand from 8th to 9th possion lighter to darker pixels.
After doing these process from entire image computer identify the edges or transition of an image and identify the image eventually.
